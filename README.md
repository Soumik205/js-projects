# Basic JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple JavaScript projects that I created while learning the basics of JavaScript. These projects serve as foundational exercises in applying JavaScript concepts and building small interactive applications.

## Projects Included

1. **Calculator**: A basic calculator application that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Product Search bar**: A simple application which can show search results from contents of a website in real time.

## How to Use

Each project directory contains the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. To run a project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's directory using a web browser.
3. Open the `index.html` file to interact with the project.

Happy coding!
